## The Insights on Crime Trends Preceding, During, and Post the Protests of 2020 ##

In my project proposal, I loaded and scraped the necessary data to begin exploring the crime trends for New York arrests and stops. I originally planned to see the external factors that may have affected arrests. However, my exploratory data analysis highlighted the disproportionate arrests, so I thought an interesting research question would be how effective the Black Lives Matter protests really were.

In todays complex society, crime reflects various factors such as race, cost of living and location. The advancement of technology through data science, offers invaluable insights into the realm of criminal activities. Conventionally, data science has been useful for predictive modelling and understanding patterns in criminal behaviour for law enforcement. Prior studies have generally focused on COVID-19 pandemic effects on crime. However, there has been a lack of research in analysing the effects of protests, such as Black Lives Matter (BLM) during these periods.
